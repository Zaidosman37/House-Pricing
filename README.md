# House-Pricing

I have Uploaded 2 folders which are the Jupyter Analysis and the Kaggle dataset.

Both are part of my practise session revolving around the Linear Regression model creation and data cleaning as well.

70 % of the Project focus on the Exploratory Data Analysis where I have cleaned and modified the datasets so that it can be deployed in the Model.

Model is based on Linear Regression where I have predicted the SalePrice (Target Variable) and checked with the Kaggle server for Final Confirmation.

Performed Regularisation Techniques such as Ridge, Lasso, & ElasticNet to check how close the prediction is coming to be.

After submission, it was found out that the best Linear Regression model  gave me around 0.14654 which belongs to Ridge Model and my worst model gave me around 0.16265 which belongs to ElasticNet.

Hence, I can confirm that the Ridge Model is performing better compared to other models.

Thank you.
